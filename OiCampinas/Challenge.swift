 Create a simple app that convert temperature to Celcius, Farenheit dan Kelvin with 3 parameter, below:
 1. Origin temperature value
 2. Origin temperature type
 3. Destination temperature type
 Output: converted temperature value
 
 You are allowed to make the best UI you could, use your creativity.

 From               To Fahrenheit               To Celsius         To Kelvin
 
 
 Fahrenheit (F)            F                    (F - 32) * 5/9    (F - 32) * 5/9 +                                                                                      273.15
 
 Celsius (C)        (C * 9/5) + 32                  C               C + 273.15
 
 Kelvin (K)        (K - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32        K - 273.15            K

 Instruction :
 - Devide the task to 4 small portion,
 1. Assign one of your team to handle the UI portion, he/she responsible to make the UI works and connect UI into logic
 2. Assign one of your team to handle Celcius conversion logic
 3. Assign one of your team to handle Fahrenheit conversion logic
 4. Assign one of your team to handle Kelvin conversion logic
 
 Remember, this is a team work, everyone are free to contribute to all of the task at any way as long as it's possitive and the objective is you guys can learn each other how to solve the problem.
 
 
 Important note:
 - Each person who assigned to each task, please create your own branch in order to do your task.
